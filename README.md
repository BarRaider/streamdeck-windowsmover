- ðŸ†• Support for moving/resizing **Apps running as administrator** 
      - Enabling the new `App is running as administrator` checkbox will elevate the permissions and allow you to control those apps too!

## New in v2.2
- :new: ***VIRTUAL DESKTOP SUPPORT***: 
    - New `Virtual Desktop Mover` action allows moving apps across Virtual Desktops. 
    - `Virtual Desktop Pin/Unpin` action  allows you to decide which apps are visible across all Virtual Desktops.
- Use along with Win Tools plugin to manage Virtual Desktops and then move the desired apps to there.
- Updated dependencies and improved load time

## New in v2.1
- `Reload Apps` button (in settings) allows to reload the most recent list of applications
- Improved Multi-Actions behavior

## Features

- Change location and size of application window
- Supported in multi-action, one click can rearrange multiple applications
- Plugin will fill coordinates  with where the windows is currently located (and also height/width of window)
- Supports Minimizing/Maximizing windows
- Option to remove the screen's "Friendly name" in cases where you have multiple monitors of the same kind.
- `Auto Retry` feature will attempt to retry moving the window if the process is not yet loaded
- `Make Topmost `feature will attempt to make the window pop up to the front of the screen
- `Location Filter` allows to filter processes to a specific directory
